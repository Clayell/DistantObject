Distant Object Enhancement bis
=============

This plugin renders effects for distant objects in Kerbal Space Program v1.0.2 and later.

Version 1.6.1 Release Notes:
- Tweaks to body flare rendering to reduce the amount of unchanging data being stored by the mod and queried every update.
- Changed computation of a constant used for flare brightness to allow for Kerbin being a child of something other than Kerbol (for instance, with the New Horizons mod).  Courtesy forum user Tynrael.

Original plugin by duckytopia (Rubber Ducky on the KSP forum).

Distant Object Enhancement bis update by MOARdV.

Known Issues:
- Some settings changed during flight do not take effect immediately (must go back to the space center before they apply).
