=============

This plugin renders effects for distant objects in Kerbal Space Program v1.0.2.

Version 1.5.6 Release Notes:
- Big flares appearing for small/dim worlds is fixed.  Issue #16.
- A few changes to hopefully reduce memory footprint when some features are not used.
- Sky dimming has been changed: Updates are shown immediately when "Apply" is pressed. Sky dimming now affects Tracking Station and Space Center views.  Planet dimming near the sun has been tweaked.

Original plugin by duckytopia (Rubber Ducky on the KSP forum).

Distant Object Enhancement bis update by MOARdV.

Known Issues:
- Some settings changed during flight do not take effect immediately (must go back to the space center before they apply).
