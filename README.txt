Distant Object Enhancement bis
=============

This plugin renders effects for distant objects in Kerbal Space Program.

Version 1.4 Release Notes:
- Fix potential NULL reference exceptions when vessels are destroyed fixed (Anatid)
- Ability to show labels on flares (planets and visible vessels) (Anatid)
- Moved flares to a different rendering layer so they're not affected by lighting illuminating the vessel, such as the PlanetShine mod (Valerian)
- Tweaked GUI (MOARdV)
- Enabled GUI in Flight in addition to Space Center view (some changes still going back to the Space Center before they take effect) (MOARdV)
- Improved handling of missing config file or missing config file entries (MOARdV)

Original plugin by duckytopia (Rubber Ducky on the KSP forum).

Distant Object Enhancement bis update by MOARdV.

Known Issues:
- When Flare Labels are enabled, they may show up even if the flare is blocked by a planet / moon / Kerbol.

- Some settings changed during flight do not take effect immediately (must go back to the space center before they apply).
